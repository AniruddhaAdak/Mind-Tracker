# Social Media Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
The Social Media Analytics Dashboard is a web application that allows users to connect their social media accounts and monitor key performance metrics in real-time. This dashboard serves as a personalized control center for tracking online presence, catering to individual influencers, small businesses, and larger organizations.

- **Interactive Data Grids**: Implement KendoReact’s grid component to provide a detailed breakdown of recent posts or activity logs, allowing users to sort, filter, and export data.
- **Customizable Layout**: Users can rearrange or resize dashboard widgets (charts, grids, etc.) for a personalized experience.
- **Cross-Platform Comparison**: Compare metrics across multiple social media platforms side by side using synchronized charts or tables.
- **Additional Enhancements**: Visualize geographic distribution of followers or track posting schedules with performance spikes.
