# Mind Tracker: Personal Mental Health Journal

*This is a submission for the [KendoReact Free Components Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/kendoreact).*

## What I Built

I've created a personal mind tracking application that helps users monitor their mental health journey. As someone who values mental wellness and self-reflection, I wanted a beautiful, intuitive tool to document my thoughts, track my moods, and identify patterns in my emotional well-being.

Mind Tracker is my passion project that came to life using KendoReact's amazing free components. I struggled to find a journaling app that was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally rich, so I decided to build my own! The multi-step entry creation process makes journaling feel less overwhelming, and the beautiful charts help me visualize my emotional patterns over time.

## KendoReact Experience

Working with KendoReact free components has been an absolute joy! I was amazed by how many powerful components were available for free. I've used over 20 KendoReact components to build Mind Tracker:

- **Input/Form Components**: TextArea, Input, Switch, MultiSelect, DropDownList, Checkbox
- **Layout Components**: TabStrip, Drawer, Card, Stepper, Step
- **Data Visualization**: Grid, Chart (pie, donut, column charts)
- **Date/Time Components**: DatePicker, TimePicker, Calendar
- **Feedback Components**: Notification, Dialog, ProgressBar
- **Interactive Elements**: Button, Upload, Tooltip

What I loved most about the KendoReact components was how naturally they worked together. The cohesive design system made creating a polished application so much easier than piecing together components from different libraries.

The documentation was excellent - every time I had a question about component props or styling, I found clear examples that helped me implement exactly what I wanted.

### AIm to Impress

I integrated AI into Mind Tracker in a subtle but powerful way. Using GitHub Copilot, I was able to accelerate my development process significantly. Copilot suggested efficient state management patterns and helped me structure the application in a scalable way.

For users, I implemented a simple sentiment analysis feature that processes journal entries to identify emotional keywords and patterns. This helps provide insights into mood trends that might not be immediately obvious from the mood selection alone. I was genuinely surprised when the app helped me realize my mood tends to improve on days when I mention outdoor activities in my journal entries!

### Delightfully Designed

I started by exploring the KendoUI Figma Kits to plan the visual design:

Using ThemeBuilder, I customized the color palette to create a calming, therapeutic aesthetic. I wanted colors that would evoke a sense of peace and reflection. The blues and purples I selected have been shown to promote calmness and introspection.

I'm particularly proud of the responsive design that works beautifully across devices. Since journaling often happens on mobile before bed, I made sure the experience was smooth on smaller screens too.

Working with the KendoReact styling system was intuitive - I could easily extend the base styles while maintaining the cohesive look and feel that makes KendoReact components special.

Building Mind Tracker with KendoReact has been one of my most enjoyable development experiences. I've already started using it daily for my own journaling, and it's helping me understand my emotional patterns in ways I never expected. I'm excited to continue enhancing it with more features and sharing it with others who might benefit from this tool for mental wellness.
